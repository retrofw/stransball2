Super Transball 2 is an enhanced version of TRANSBALL 2, which is the sequel of TRANSBALL, 
a remake of the classic THRUST game (but mainly inspired in ZARA THRUSTA for the Commodore
Amiga 500).

The game has many levels, in each level the goal is to find the white sphere, and  carry
it to the upper part of the screen. This may seem easy at the begining, but as the levels
become more and more complicated, to reach the top of the screen can be extremely difficult...
To move through a the levels, you command a ship, that is atracted by the gravity of the
planet. As if this wasn't enough, you will find enemies that fire you, doors and many other 
difficulties on your way...

You can choose between 3 possible ships:
- the SHADOW RUNNER: extremrly fast, and with retropropulsors. But with very unpowerful
wepons. This is not a ship for beginners, but is very good ship when you can control it!
- the V-PANTHER 2: the easiest to control ship. Medium speed, and medium weapons. 
- the X-TERMINATOR: really slow (and easy to control), but has very powerful weapons. The
tactic you must follow with this ship is: as I cannot evade your bullets, I'LL KILL YOU!!

Depending on the type of your gameplay, you could find one ship better than another, but
in principle there's no ship better than the other two.

To learn how to play, just wait for 5-10 seconds in the tittle screen, and some demos will
appear. The replaysof all the levels you play are saved. After you dye of finidh the game,
 go to the REPLAY section, and you will find all your games saved as "AUTOREPLAY???.RPL",
just rename those that you want to keep, all the no-renamed replays will be deleted 
automatically the next time you play the game... 
Ah! If you think you are better player than me, just send me your replay files!!!! ;)


This game has been developed using Visual C++ 6.0 and the SDL library (with SDL_image,
SDL_mixer and SDL_sge). If you want the sources, just e-mail me and I will send them to
you! Also e-mail me for any suggestion, bug, etc.

So... HAPPY GRAVITATION!!!

What's new in version 1.5:
- the game now uses less CPU
- added 200%, 300% and 400% zoom for windowed modes (use ALT-1, ALT-2, ALT-3 and ALT-4
  to activate them).
- fullscreen/zoom configuration is saved to disk
- improved the FASTEST replays manager. Now, if you copy any replays into the "replays"
  folder, you can update the FASTEST replays by going to the replay view, and "rebuilding".
  Moreover, notice that only the replays related to the current level pack will be 
  updated, if you want to update the FASTEST replays of all the level packs, you have
  to manually switch from a level pack to the next and rebuild the FASTEST list for
  each level pack.
- fixed a problem while redefining keys in linux

What's new in version 1.4:
- Menus are now browsed jsut with CURSOR KEYS
- Time mode has been disappeared, and the time (only at "second" precision) is shown while
  you play

  again the same level
- improved the navigation through the replays (PGUP/PGDOWN)
- Improved the ATRACTOR graphic
- The FASTEST replays are kept automatically in the HIGH folder (you can see them by going
  to the REPLAYS menu, and pressing TAB)
